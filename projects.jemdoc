== Deep Learning & SVM for Image Reconstruction, [https://mcmaster.ca McMaster University], Canada,   Sep’17-Jan’18
- Developed DeepNet/SVM in Python (TensorFlow with CUDA, Scikit Learn) for image reconstruction
- Conceptualized the learning problem and generated input & output data from original RGB image
- Trained and tested the machine leaning models on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 (g2.2xlarge) GPUs

== Perceptron & SVM for Classification, [https://mcmaster.ca McMaster University], Canada, Sep’17-Dec’18      
- Applied 2 machine learning algorithms (Perceptron and SVM) in Python for large scale data classification 
- Compared and evaluated Perceptron and SVM performances by creating confusion matrices
