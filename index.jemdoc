Smriti Shyamal is currently employed as Machine Learning Specialist in [https://www.xanadu.ai Xanadu]. Prior to joining [https://www.xanadu.ai Xanadu], he worked as Machine Learning Scientist in [https://1qbit.com 1QBit]. He completed his Ph.D. in June'18 at [https://mcmaster.ca McMaster University], Canada, where
he was supervised   
by [http://macc.mcmaster.ca/profile.php?personid=120 Dr. Christoper L.E. Swartz]. He received his 
B.Tech degree from [http://www.iitb.ac.in Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay],
India in 2013. His current
research focus is on deep learning, rinforcement learning, data science, machine learning, optimization and control applications.
